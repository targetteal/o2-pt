# Preface

**Organic Organization (O2)** is a catalyst that helps organizations and their subparts (teams, departments, units) embrace self-management. O2 is composed of its **Rule Book** and an ever growing [Pattern Library](https://targetteal.com/o2/library/).

Anyone who agrees to take part of an **Organic Organization** may rely on the rules here presented and also agrees to be bound by its duties and constraints.

# Organizational Structure

**Organic Organizations** have an _Organizational Structure_ composed of _Roles_, _Circles_, and _Restrictions_, which define expectations and limitations of authority. Those elements form a hierarchy of _Circles_, and are described in details in the upcoming section. The _Organizational Structure_ of a _Circle_ can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of its _Circle Meeting_.  

## Roles

Members of the organization will typically perform work for the organization in one or more explicitly defined _Roles_.

A _Role_ is a part of the organization composed of:
- A descriptive name (mandatory);
- A _Purpose_, which is a capacity, potential, or unrealizable goal that the _Role_ will pursue or express;
- _Accountabilities_, which are recurring activities that others can expect the _Role_ will perform (optional);
- _Artifacts_, which are things that the _Role_ can exclusively control and regulate for the organization (optional).

## Circles

_Circles_ are analogous structures to _Roles_, and thus have the same properties described in the _Role_ section.

_Circles_ can contain _Roles_ and inner _Circles_, that can contain their own _Roles_ and inner _Circles_, and so on. The structure is fractal. From the perspective of an outer _Circle_, its inner _Circles_ are like _Roles_ that have the additional ability to break themselves down.

_Circles_ are composed of _Roles_ and inner _Circles_, not people. You are a _Circle Member_ if you fill a _Role_ in that same _Circle_.

Inner _Circle_ properties (name, _Purpose_, _Accountabilities_, and _Artifacts_) can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of its outer _Circle Meeting_.

A _Circle_ _Artifact_ can be accessed by all _Circle Members_, except if it has been delegated to a specific _Role_ in that _Circle_.

The organization itself is the broadest _Circle_ in the structure, containing all other ones.

Inner _Circles_ are created for the purpose of maintaining the _Circle Meetings_ with a manageable number of people and clear focus.  

## Restrictions

_Restrictions_ are limitations of authority that apply to all _Roles_ of a given _Circle_.

_Restrictions_ are composed of a title and a description (both mandatory).

_Restrictions_ cascade to all inner _Circles_, unless otherwise specified in the description.

_Restrictions_ cannot set expectations, because that is the goal of an _Accountability_. Nevertheless, a _Restriction_ may demand action, but only for the individuals to which the _Restriction_ applies in the specific condition that triggers it.

# Rights

When taking part of an **Organic Organization**, _Circle Members_ have two basic rights.

## No implicit expectations

You may deny requests to take specific projects and actions if no matching explicit _Accountability_ is captured in the requested _Role_'s description. However, you should always accept projects and actions if you think they fit your _Role_'s purpose, even if no explicit _Accountability_ is recorded.

## Everything is allowed by default

When pursuing your _Role_'s _Purpose_, you are always allowed to take action, unless an explicit _Artifact_ or _Circle_ _Restriction_ says otherwise.

# Duties

When taking part of an **Organic Organization**, _Circle Members_ have some basic duties towards one another.

## Expressing Roles

You are responsible for monitoring how your _Role_'s _Purpose_ and _Accountabilities_ are expressed, and comparing that to your vision of their ideal potential expression. You should identify those gaps between the current reality and a potential you sense, each one being a tension.

You are also responsible for trying to resolve those tensions by using the authorities and other mechanisms available to you under the Rule Book.

## Transparency

When requested, you are expected to share all relevant information about your _Roles_' work, including each project you are working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics.

Upon request, you are also expected to give estimates and projections about possible completion dates of projects and actions, even though those projections shall not be considered deadlines or commitments.

## Prioritization

You are expected to prioritize your work in alignment with _Circle_ priorities defined by the _Outer Link_, or any other process that sets priorities.

## Circle Meetings

When requested by other _Circle Members_, you should prioritize attending to the _Circle Meetings_ over working on your _Roles_' project and actions.

# Circle Meetings

_Circle Members_ regularly gather in a space called _Circle Meeting_ in order to perform one or more of the 5 special modes described in the upcoming sections: _Review_, _Sync_, _Adapt_, _Select_, and _Care_.

_Circle Members_ can invite people that are not _Circle Members_ to solve particular issues or process tensions.

_Circle Meetings_ are scheduled by the _Circle_'s _Secretary_ and facilitated by the _Facilitator_, two special _Roles_ described in the core _Roles_ section.

## Meeting format

_Circle Meetings_ start with a check in round and end with a check out round. The _Facilitator_ fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 different modes, according to the time available and the needs of the _Circle_.

In the check in round, one at a time, each participant shares how he or she is coming to the meeting.

In the check out round, one at a time, each participant shares a closing reflection about the meeting.

The _Facilitator_ should not allow any discussion or crosstalk in both rounds, in order to preserve the individual space of every _Circle Member_.

The different modes should never be mixed together. The _Facilitator_ must state the name, goal, and clarify rules of each mode before beginning to facilitate each one.

## Review Mode

The goal of the _Review Mode_ is to give transparency about the _Circle_'s work. That is usually accomplished by reviewing metrics, recurring actions, and projects.

It's up to the _Facilitator_ to decide how specifically the _Review Mode_ is conducted, except if a _Restriction_ determines otherwise.

Detailed suggestions can be found in the **Pattern Library**.

## Sync Mode

The goal of the _Sync Mode_ is to quickly process tensions into actions, projects, information requests and information sharing.

The _Facilitator_ starts by asking the _Secretary_ to build a list of tensions to process. Each person feeling a tension must label it using two or three words aloud. The _Secretary_ then records the label, along with the name of the participant.

The _Facilitator_ must not give any more space to allow the person to explain the tension during the process of building the list.

After the tension list is built, the _Facilitator_ must go through the list and process one tension at a time, trying to help the item owner to get what he or she needs.

The _Facilitator_ must simply allow the list item owner to engage others in their _Roles_ and duties as desired, until a path for resolving the tension is identified.

The _Facilitator_ must attempt to allow time for processing every tension list item within the _Sync Mode_, and in order to do so may cut off the processing of any item that’s taking more than its due share of the remaining time.

The _Secretary_ then records any requested projects and actions accepted by the participants.

The _Sync Mode_ structure can be changed entirely with a _Restriction_, provided that the goal is maintained.

## Adapt Mode

The goal of the _Adapt Mode_ is to process tensions into structural changes in the _Circle_. These changes include:

- Adding, removing or changing _Circle_ _Roles_;
- Adding, removing or changing inner _Circles_;
- Adding, removing or changing _Circle_ _Restrictions_;

What can be done in the _Adapt Mode_ can only be done inside the _Adapt Mode_. This means that you cannot add, remove or change the _Circle_ structure outside this mode. Except for asynchronous proposals.

The _Facilitator_ must ask the _Secretary_ to build a list of tensions to process, exactly as described in the _Sync Mode_.

After the tension list is built, the _Facilitator_ must guide the resolution of each tension list item, using the following process guidelines:

- Quick proposal building
- One tension at a time
- Example-based proposals only
- Structural changes only
- Personal expression equivalence
- Integrative decision-making

### Quick proposal building

The tension list item owner should be able to present a proposal to solve his or her own tension in the process.

Alternatively, the _Facilitator_ may allow the item owner to ask help from other participants to craft the proposal. If that is the case, the _Facilitator_ should not allow any consensus building process. The goal is to solve the item owner's tension, not to satisfy everyone.

### One tension at a time

The tensions should be processed one at a time. This means that the _Facilitator_ should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives and/or tensions in the current proposal, unless the item owner deems those perspectives are useful to solve his or her own tension.

### Example-based proposals only

The item owner must explain the tension and give an example about a past or present situation where each part of the crafted proposal would solve or reduce the tension. That is mandatory.

If the _Facilitator_ deems that the item owner has failed to present the required example and explanations, the _Facilitator_ must discard the proposal. Nevertheless, the _Facilitator_ should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

### Structural changes only

To be a valid output for the _Adapt Mode_, the proposal should be composed only of structural changes. If that is not the case, any participant can raise a Rule Book violation objection.

### Personal expression equivalence

Each participant of the _Circle_ should have the same space and the option to ask questions or express his or her opinion during the execution of the _Adapt Mode_. How exactly this space is made available is up to the _Facilitator_.

### Integrative decision-making

The _Facilitator_ must use an integrative decision-making process to facilitate the resolution of each tension. That means that any participant must be allowed to raise one or more objections to the proposal.

If no objections are raised, the proposal is accepted.

If there are objections, they must be integrated to the proposal.

#### Objections

An objection is a reason why the proposal would cause harm to the _Circle_ and move it backwards. The _Facilitator_ can ask questions to help the objector understand if his or her objection is valid. These questions must evaluate:

1. **Degradation**. The objection is about some harm that the proposal would cause to the _Circle_. This harm must be explained.
2. **Causality**. The objection must be caused by the proposal in order to be valid.
3. **Data-based**. The objection is based on current data or past experience. In other words, it's not an anticipation of future events. However, if the claimed harm is so disastrous that the _Circle_ would not be able to adapt in the future, then the objection can be predictive and this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The objection affects one of the objector _Roles_ in the _Circle_.

When validating objections, the _Facilitator_ should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid objections are moved to integration.

#### Rule Book violation objection

Any participant can raise a "Rule Book violation objection" if he or she deems the proposal violates one of the rules described in this Rule Book. For example, one might say that a proposal is not a valid output for the _Adapt Mode_.

In this case, the _Facilitator_ can ask the _Secretary_ to decide whether this is true or not. This special objection does not need to be validated using the criteria described in this section. Rule Book violation objections must be integrated normally.

### Integration

After harvesting valid objections, the _Facilitator_ must guide their integration to the proposal. One objection should be integrated at a time. The goal is to craft an amended proposal that would solve the original tension without causing the objection.

If the proposal is amended, the _Facilitator_ must give another opportunity to the participants to raise objections.

If a proposal is taking too much time to integrate, the _Facilitator_ can discard the proposal entirely in order to move to the next tension list item.

### Asynchronous Proposals

Structural changes can be proposed outside _Circle Meetings_ and are automatically adopted if all _Circle Members_ declare that they don't have any objections. If any objections are raised, the proposal must be escalated to the _Adapt Mode_ of a _Circle Meeting_.

It's up to the _Secretary_ to define how this process is accomplished.

## Select Mode

The goal of the _Select Mode_ is to select _Circle Members_ to fill the three structural _Roles_: _Facilitator_, _Secretary_ and _Inner Link_.

Anyone in the _Circle_ can ask for the _Facilitator_ to jump to the _Select Mode_ and perform an election for one of the three elected _Roles_. If that is the case, this should be done immediately.

The process of electing the three structural _Roles_ must be done only inside a _Circle Meeting_.

The _Facilitator_ must facilitate an election process, considering the following rules:

- Every _Circle Member_ is eligible for all three elected _Roles_, with the exception of the person who fills the _Outer Link_ mode, which is not eligible as _Facilitator_ or _Inner Link_.
- If there is a tie, the _Facilitator_ can chose one of the following criteria to untie:
  - The person who named him or herself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
  - The person who is already filling the _Role_, if only one of the tied candidates is;
  - Random;
- The person who fills the _Outer Link_ _Role_ cannot be elected as _Facilitator_ or _Inner Link_ of the same _Circle_.
- Only _Circle Members_ are eligible as _Facilitator_, _Secretary_ or _Inner Link_.

For examples of election processes for the _Select Mode_, see the **Pattern Library**.

The structure of the _Select Mode_ can be restricted using a _Restriction_, provided that the goal is maintained and the rules above are followed.

## Care Mode

The goal of this mode is to care for the tribal space, and nurture the quality of relationships between _Circle Members_. The format is open for the _Facilitator_ to decide how to use.

This space should not be used to make changes to the structure of the _Circle_ or ask projects and actions from other _Circle Members_.

# Core Roles

Every _Circle_ has 4 core _Roles_ automatically created: _Outer Link_, _Inner Link_, _Facilitator_, and _Secretary_.

The _Facilitator_ and the _Secretary_ are elected in the _Select Mode_ and operate mainly inside _Circle Meetings_.

The _Outer Link_ and _Inner Link_ are used to exchange messages and facilitate communication between _Circle_ and external _Circle_, specially during _Circle Meetings_.

## Outer Link

The _Outer Link_ is chosen by the external _Circle_, by whatever process that assigns people to _Roles_ in the external _Circle_.

The _Outer Link_ is accountable for assigning people to _Roles_ in the _Circle_, and may invite any person that is part of the organization, unless a _Restriction_ says otherwise.

The _Outer Link_ can also establish priorities for the _Circle_, and _Circle Members_ are expected to align with those priorities.

The _Outer Link_ _Role_ can be excluded or modified entirely with a _Restriction_.

The _Outer Link_ holds all _Circle_ un-delegated _Artifacts_ and _Accountabilities_.
