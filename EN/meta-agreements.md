# 1. Organization

The "Organization" is an entity created to express an [Evolutionary Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#proposito-evolutivo). An Organization has assets that it controls and a clear border with the outside world.


# **1.1 Evolutionary Purpose**

The [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#proposito-evolutivo), which corresponds to the deepest creative potential that it can express in a sustainable way in the world. The Evolutionary Purpose is the Purpose of the wider Circle of the Organizational Structure.) has an "Evolutionary Purpose", which corresponds to the deepest creative potential that it can express in a sustainable way in the world. The Evolutionary Purpose is the [Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of the largest [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) of the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional).


# **1.2 Partners**

"Partners" are people who dedicate their time and energy to help the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#organizacao) express its [Evolutionary Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#proposito-evolutivo).


# **1.3 Creative Tensions**

While working for the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros), [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) can identify a difference between the current reality and a potential that they perceive. These gaps, which can be identified problems or opportunities, are called "Creative Tensions", or simply "Tensions". Tensions move the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) towards its [Evolutionary Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#proposito-evolutivo).


# **1.4 Self Responsibility**

As a [Partner](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros), you are responsible for addressing the [Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) you perceive, taking actions or engaging other [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) in these [Meta-Agreements](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes). You are also expected to ask for help when you don't know which paths to take. This responsibility cannot be transferred to third parties or to a group.


# **1.5 Transparency**

As a [Partner](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros), you are expected to share, when asked by other [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros), all relevant information about the work you do for the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros), including your projects, identified actions, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics. When requested, you are also expected to provide estimates and projections of possible completion dates for your work, even if these projections should not be considered deadlines or commitments.


# **1.6 Heroic Act**

You can temporarily ignore these [Meta-Agreements](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) if this is useful and necessary to express the [Evolutionary Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#proposito-evolutivo) of the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros). Initiatives or requests that have this quality are called "Heroic Acts". You should always seek to repair any damage caused after a Heroic Act, proposing changes in the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) or even in these [Meta-Agreements](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) if necessary.

# 2. Organizational Structure

[Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) can define a layer of agreements that establish expectations and limitations of authority between them. This layer, called "Organizational Structure", is organized in a hierarchy of [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and formed by [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Policies](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes). Each [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) governs its Organizational Structure, which can only be changed in [Adapt Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar).


# **2.1 Roles**

[Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) perform work in one or more "Roles" explicitly defined in the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional). A Role is defined by:



*   A descriptive name;
*   A "Purpose", which is an unattainable capacity, potential or objective that the Paper will pursue or express;
*   Zero or more "Responsibilities", which are ongoing activities that other [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) can expect the Role to perform;
*   Zero or more "Artifacts", which are assets that the Paper can exclusively control and regulate on behalf of the [Organization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao).


## **2.1.1 Energizing Roles**

"Energizing" refers to that which [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) devote their time and energy to, in order to express the [Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of their [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis). To energize is not a component of the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional), although it can determine how and under what conditions it occurs.


## **2.1.2 Role Authority**

When pursuing the [Role's](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) Purpose that you energize, you are always allowed to take action. However, you must not impact the [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) defined in [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that you do not energize or [Circle Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that you are not a [Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) of, without first obtaining explicit permission from the Responsible [Partner](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros). You must also observe the [Policies](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) defined in the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) and follow the conditions established therein.

You can also refuse a request if there is no corresponding explicit [accountability](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) in the description of the [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) being requested. Still, you must accept any requests that make sense for the [Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of any of the [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that you energize.


## **2.1.3 Leaving Roles**

You may, at any time, stop energizing [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) in one or more [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos), unless you have agreed to do otherwise with the [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) or to another [Energization](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#energizacao) process.


# **2.2 Circles**

A "Circle" is a [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) that has the authority to divide into smaller [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis), contained within itself. When a [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) is transformed into a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos), the [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) that energize it become the [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) of that [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) are defined exactly like [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis), that is, through the elements name, [Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis), [Responsibilities](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis).


## **2.2.1 Circles don't change their definition  **

A[ Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can govern its own [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes), but it cannot change its own definition (purpose, responsibilities or artifacts), this must be done in the outer or external [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) that contains in it this inner or internal [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).


## **2.2.2 Circles don't structure their internal Circles **

A [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) cannot change the [roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis), [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) and [Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) of an inner [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) directly. However, a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can perform some operations in [Adapt Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar), such as moving [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) from itself to its internal [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) and vice versa.


# **2.3 A Circle's Artifacts **

When a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) has [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) in its definition, only Members of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) and internal [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can impact these [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) freely.


## **2.3.1 Circles can delegate Artifacts **

A [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can specify one of its [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) as pertaining to a particular [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or Inner [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). If this is done, that [Artifact](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) becomes exclusive to the [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or Inner [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos), until this delegation is undone.


# **2.4 Circle Members**

[Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) are considered "Members" of a given [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) when they meet at least one of the criteria below:

Energize at least one [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) defined in the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos);

Energize at least one of the Essential [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) in the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos);

Energize the [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) or [Internal Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-interno) in at least one of the [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) internal to the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).


# **2.5 Restrictions**

"[Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes)" are limitations of authority that apply to all [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) in a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). [Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) are made up of a name and a description. Unless otherwise specified in its description, the effect of a [Restriction](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) applies to all [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) within the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) where it is defined. A [Restriction](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) is part of a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos), just like a [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or Inner [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).


# **2.6 Circle Priorities**

A [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can establish priorities to guide the work of its [Members](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo). As a [Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo), you must prioritize your work in alignment with the established guidelines.


# 3. Circle Meetings

[Circle members](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) regularly meet in what is called the "Circle Meeting" to perform one or more of the 4 special meeting "Modes" described in the following section: [Review](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-revisar), [Synchronize](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-sincronizar), [Adapt](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar) and [Care](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-cuidar). Circle meetings are scheduled by the [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) and facilitated by the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador), two [Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais).


# **3.1 Only Members can process tensions**

[Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) who are not [Circle Members](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) cannot process [tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) at [Circle Meetings](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo). However, [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) may be invited by a [Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) to assist in processing a specific [tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes). In this case, the [tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) to be processed will still be considered by the [Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) and not by the [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros).


# **3.2 Meeting Format**

[Circle Meetings](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) must start with a check-in round, where one at a time, each participant shares how he or she is. The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) fills the meeting with one or more of the 4 [Modes](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo), according to the time available and the needs of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must declare the name, objective and clarify the rules of each Mode before starting it. The [Circle Meetings](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) end with a closing round, where one at a time, each participant shares a final reflection on the meeting.


## **3.2.1 The Tension Backlog**

The different [Modes](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) are used to process specific [Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) felt by [Circle Members](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo). Especially before[ Synchronizing](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-sincronizar) and [Adapting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar), the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should ask the [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) to build a "List of Tensions" to be processed. Each [Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) feeling a [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) must name it using two or three words. The [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) then records the name of the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes), along with the name of the [Partner](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros).


## **3.2.2 One Tension at a Time**

After the [Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) are listed, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) focuses on one [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) at a time. This means that the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should not allow other participants to attempt to include their perspectives in the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) being processed, unless the participant who originally felt the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) believes that perspective is useful.


# **3.3 Facilitation Restrictions**

When facilitating [Modes](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo), the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) can make choices about which patterns to use and how to conduct each moment. However, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must always keep his choices in line with the objective of the [Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) and the needs of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). A [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) may also adopt one or more [Restriction](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) that limits how the Modes are conducted. The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must respect these limitations.


## **3.3.1 Elections are a Priority**

If any [Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) requests the [Election](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#eleicoes) of any of the [Essential Elected Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#papeis-essenciais-eleitos), the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must prioritize that [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) by addressing it before any other.


# **3.4 Review Mode**

The "Review Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) whose objective is to give transparency to the work done by the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). It is up to the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) to decide how specifically the [Review Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-revisar) is conducted, unless a [Restriction](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) determines otherwise.

See the Patterns to Review in the [Patterns Library](https://o2.targetteal.com/v/v3.1-pt/biblioteca)


# **3.5 Sincronize Mode**

The "Synchronize Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) whose objective is to quickly process [Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) that do not require the[ Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) to update its [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional). Typical Sync Mode outputs include actions, projects, help requests and information sharing. The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should simply allow each participant who brought a [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) to engage others in their [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) until a path to resolve the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) is identified. The [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) records any requests accepted by other participants in their [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or as Heroic Acts.

See the Patterns to Review in the [Patterns Library](https://o2.targetteal.com/v/v3.1-pt/biblioteca)


# **3.6 Adapt Mode**

The "Adapt Mode" is a moment that occurs in [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo). The objective is to process [Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes) related to the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos). The only valid and permissible outputs in Adapt Mode are:



*   Add, remove or change [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis);
*   Add, remove or change Internal [circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos);
*   Add, remove or change [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) [Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes);
*   Move your [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis),[ Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) or Inner [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) to an Inner Circle;
*   Move [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis), [Restrictions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#restricoes) or [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) from an inner Circle to you;
*   Transform your [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) into Inner [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos), and vice versa.


## **3.6.1 Proposal**

During [Adapt Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar), the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must facilitate a process that allows the participant who brought the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes), the "Proponent", to build a "Proposal" to resolve it. This Proposal must contain only the operations described as valid outputs from [Adapt Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar).


## **3.6.2 Presenting Examples**

The [Proponent ](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta)of a change in the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) must be able to present examples of past or present situations where each part of the constructed [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) would resolve or reduce the [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes). If the[ Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) considers that the [Proponent](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) was unable to provide examples and clarification, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must discard the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta). However, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but rather if they have been presented with logical reasoning and are therefore plausible.


## **3.6.3 Objections**

The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must allow each participant to have the opportunity to raise one or more "[Objections](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes)" to the submitted [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta). An [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) is one reason why the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) causes harm and moves the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) backwards. The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) can ask questions to help the "Objector" understand whether what he has brought is a "Valid [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes)" or not.


## **3.6.4 Validating Objections**

An [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) to a Proposed Change in the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) is considered valid if the [Objector](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) believes that it meets all of the following 4 criteria:



1. Degradation. The [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) is about harm that [Proposal ](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta)could do to the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).
2. Related to Roles. [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) affects one of the [Objector's](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) Roles in the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).
3. Causality. This evil is caused by the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta), that is, it would not exist without it.
4. Based on data. The [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) is based on current data or past experience, so it is not an anticipation of future events. However, if the alleged damage is so disastrous that the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) would not be able to adapt in the future, then this criterion can be disregarded.

In validating [Objections](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes), the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are therefore plausible. Valid [objections](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) must be integrated.


## **3.6.5 Integrating Objections**

If there are [objections](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes), the [facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should facilitate a process for integrating them into the proposal, one at a time. The purpose of "Integration" is to modify the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) so that it resolves the original [Tension](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes), but without causing the objection raised. If the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) is changed, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) should provide another opportunity for participants to raise [Objections](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes). If a [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) is taking a long time to integrate, the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) can discard the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) entirely in order to move on to the next item on the [List of Tensions](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#tensoes).


## **3.6.6 Breach of Meta-Agreements**

Any participant may raise an [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) to "Breach of[ Meta-Agreements](https://o2.targetteal.com/v/v3.1-pt/meta-acordos)" if he or she considers that the [Proposal](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#proposta) violates one of the rules described in these [Meta-Agreements](https://o2.targetteal.com/v/v3.1-pt/meta-acordos). The [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) must then ask the [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) to interpret whether this is true or not. This special [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) does not need to be validated against the criteria normally used, but it must be integrated like the others.


## 3.6.7 **Asynchronous Proposals**

Changes to the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) may be proposed outside the [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) and are automatically approved if all [Circle Members](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) declare that they have no objection. If any [Objection](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#objecoes) is raised or a participant declares that he / she would like to treat the Tension in a conventional manner, the Proposal should be escalated to [Adapt Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo#modo-adaptar) for a conventional [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo).See the [Patterns Library](https://o2.targetteal.com/v/v3.1-pt/biblioteca)


# **3.7 Care Mode**

The "Caring Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) whose objective is to stimulate the presence and connection between the participants. This [Mode](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) should not be used to make changes to the [Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) of the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) or to engage [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) in their [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and Responsibilities.

# **3.8 Prioritizing Meetings**

When requested by another [Member of a Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) of which you are a member, you must prioritize attending the [Circle Meeting](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#reunioes-de-circulo) rather than working on your [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis).



# 4. Essential Roles

Each[ Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) contains "Essential Roles": The [ External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo),[ Internal Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-interno),[ Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) and[ Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario).


# **4.1 Elected Essential Roles**

The [ Essential Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais) of[ Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador),[ Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) a[ Lead Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-interno) are considered "Essential Elected Roles" and are energized using an election process.

**4.1.1 Eligible Partners**

All and only the[ Circle Members ](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo)are eligible to energize the [Essential Elected Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#papeis-essenciais-eleitos). Even still, [ Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) that energize the [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of[ External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) can't energize the  [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of[ Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador) or[ Internal Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-interno) in the same [ Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).


## **4.1.2 Elections**

Any [ Circle Member ](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo)can solicit  "Elections" for the [Essential Elected Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#papeis-essenciais-eleitos). The Election process is initially made by a simple majority to choose a person who will be nominated and then consent is used to effect the nomination. Each[ Circle Member](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#membros-do-circulo) has the right to just one vote. The [ Organizational Structure](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional) can define in what conditions the process should be facilitated.


# **4.2 Altering Essential Roles**

The [Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais) of each [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) can be changed, as long as the restrictions below are respected:

The name and [Purpose](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of [Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais) cannot be changed;

New [Accountabilities](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) cannot be added to the [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of the [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo);

Initial [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) [Accountabilities](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) can be modified or removed altogether, as long as they are delegated to another [Role](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) or process in the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos);

The Initial [Accountabilities](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) and [Artifacts](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) of the [Facilitator](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#facilitador), [Secretary](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#secretario) and [Internal Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-interno) [Roles ](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis)cannot be removed or modified;

[Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais) cannot be removed.


## **4.2.1 Alterations to the Essential Roles don't extend to Internal Circles**

Changes made to the [Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais) of a [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) apply only to the [Circle](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos) where the change occurred, that is, they do not extend to the internal [Circles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#circulos).


# **4.3 Energizing Defined Roles**

The [External Link](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais#elo-externo) is responsible for inviting [Partners](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#organizacao#parceiros) to energize the [Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#estrutura-organizacional#papeis) defined in the Circle, with the exception of [Essential Roles](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization/blob/master/EN/meta-agreements.md#papeis-essenciais).
